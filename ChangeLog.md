- if not already, load full template when creating new mission
- expose new providerMissionId
- disable subscription stuff for now
- adjustment to enable ui dispatch from mxm-server (via quarkus-quinoa)
  - some tests with history mode
- some basic setup for subscriptions, but seems limited/nonfunctional until migrating to vue3
- separated webapp project from the initial prototype
