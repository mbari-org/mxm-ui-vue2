# Copy the JSON contents below into a `config.json` file, which should be located
# appropriately depending on how you will be running the application:
#
# - Docker release:    Put `config.json` under a directory of your choosing, which
#                      you will indicate prior to running the mxm container.
#
# - Local development: Put `config.json` under `src/statics/config/`.
#
# Then edit `config.json` as needed:
#
# - graphqlUri:  (Required)
#   Indicates the external URI of the MXM GraphQL endpoint.
#   The default value here, "http://localhost:38080/mxm-graphql", is just intended
#   for basic local testing using the dockerized package.
#
# - learnMoreUrl: (Optional)
#   If defined, a corresponding link will be included at the top of the app.
#
# - googleApiKey: (Optional)
#   If defined and properly configured, some Google Map base layers will be
#   available for selection for the map.
